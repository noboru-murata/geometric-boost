* geometric-boost

Boosting is an algorithm specific to machine learning that efficiently
collects weak learners and augments them into a strong learner.

Each step of Boosting is the estimation of a weak learner using
weighted data, but when reconsidered in the space of probability
distributions, it can be understood as a special coordinate gradient descent
method that sequentially updates a special learning model based on the
previously acquired learner with the original data.
